## Overview
This academic project focused on recreating the classic Snake Game from scratch using object-oriented programming principles in **Java**. The goal was to understand and apply core OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction in a hands-on, engaging context. An additional layer of complexity was added by supporting **multiple user integration**, allowing different players to interact with the game logic individually.

## Key Features
- **Classic Snake Gameplay:** Rebuilt the entire mechanics of the snakeâ€™s movement, food consumption, and collision detection.
- **Object-Oriented Architecture:** Utilized Java OOP principles to structure the game into classes like `Snake`, `GameBoard`, `Player`, and `Food`.
- **Multi-User Support:** Integrated a system allowing multiple players to register and play, storing their progress or scores.
- **GUI Interface:** Simple and intuitive graphical interface for real-time interaction and display.

## Learnings & Challenges
This project significantly deepened my understanding of **Java OOP fundamentals**. I learned how to design modular and scalable applications by structuring code into reusable and maintainable classes. Managing game state and dynamic behavior, such as snake movement and collisions, required precise control logic and efficient memory handling.

A key challenge was maintaining performance and logical consistency as new players were introduced. Ensuring that each player session was isolated yet integrated into the overall system required thoughtful architectural design.

## Outcome
Completing this project greatly enhanced my **technical and conceptual grasp of object-oriented programming in Java**. It provided me with practical experience in game logic, interface design, and multi-user data handling. The structured approach and hands-on problem-solving honed both my coding discipline and my ability to build interactive applications. This foundational experience has since supported my confidence in tackling larger Java-based systems and collaborative development tasks.
